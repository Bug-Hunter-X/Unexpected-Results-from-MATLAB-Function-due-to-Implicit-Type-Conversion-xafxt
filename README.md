# Unexpected Results from MATLAB Function due to Implicit Type Conversion

This repository contains a MATLAB function that exhibits unexpected behavior due to a subtle bug related to implicit type conversion or a logical error within conditional statements. The issue is challenging to detect using typical debugging approaches.

## Description

The `myFunction.m` file contains a MATLAB function that is intended to perform a specific computation. However, under certain input conditions, it produces unexpected or incorrect results. The reason for this unexpected behavior lies in either the implicit type conversion performed by MATLAB or a flaw within the function's logic, particularly in how conditional statements (if-else blocks) handle different data types or values.

The provided `bug.m` and `bugSolution.m` files serve as concrete examples of both the erroneous function and its corrected version. The primary goal is to highlight the difficulties in identifying and resolving such subtle bugs and to demonstrate a systematic approach to debugging and refining MATLAB code.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `bug.m` in MATLAB.
3.  Run the example usage at the end of the file. Observe the unexpected output.
4.  Compare the buggy `bug.m` version with the corrected `bugSolution.m` version to understand the subtle fix.
